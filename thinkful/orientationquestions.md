# Orientation Questions

## Focus on answering these questions:

* When will I spend time reading the curriculum?
  * I've talked with my family and I can count on having evenings and weekends, but I will also try to squeeze in some time during the day when possible.
* When I run into difficulty, what are my options to get support?
  * It sounds like I should have an awesome mentor available ;-) Additionally I know there's Google and the Thinkful Slack channel.
* When will I spend time practicing coding and building projects?
  * In the same time I have allotted above for reading the curriculum.
* Am I prepared to deal with unexpected demands on my time?
  * I'm prepared to be busy for the next 6 months if that's what you mean.
