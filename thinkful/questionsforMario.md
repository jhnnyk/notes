* line 24 vs line 30 and how I'm using `this`. it works in this setup, but I'm curious if I need the `$` or which is the preferred method. if I don't use the `$` on line 24 it breaks


  * event.target.reset()

* `try`, `catch`, `finally` are new to me
* are most people still using jQuery a lot or should I be thinking about doing most of my projects with vanilla JS?
* for logic flow with if statements, is it better to use `else if`'s or separate if statements?
* so "side effects", is that when a function modifies some part of the program outside of the function? if that is to be avoided, should we try to have functions always create or return new variables?
  * would my solution here be considered a side effect? should I have used `map` to return a new array?
* from the drills: is there a reason I couldn't use the ES6 style function for the method here: https://repl.it/G9Lj/500

* is there any difference in scope between `const` and `let`?
* I've read that you should use `const` until you run into an issue and only then use `let`. Would you say that's correct?
* do you care whether or not I use semicolons in JS?
* do you have any advice on variable naming?
  * something like `isSomething` for booleans
* function declarations vs. function expressions? es6 style functions?
