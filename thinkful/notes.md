* watched the [alumni spotlight video of Thinkful graduate Dakota Bryant](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6oexDsjxushSThHNUdZcFAzUFk/view) who landed a job *before* graduating.
  * http://www.dakotabryant.com/
    * he used [fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/) to understand what was good and bad about his portfolio website
    * he worked an additional 6-8 hours each day building more projects *outside* of the Thinkful curriculum

* [Deeper into objects](https://courses.thinkful.com/web-dev-001v1/assignment/2.6.4) - `Object.keys` and **factory functions**: stuff I didn't really get before. Kind of an 'ah-ha!' moment here!

* [Array methods](https://courses.thinkful.com/web-dev-001v1/assignment/2.4.3) - really good explanations of `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.slice()`, `.sort()`, `.map()`, `.forEach()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, and `.find()`.
