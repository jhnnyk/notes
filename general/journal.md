Seems like a few decent decisions on my plate at the moment...

Coding(school) plans... I don't know. Right this second the best option seems to be to keep on the road I'm on, finish the Treehouse Techdegree then work on a couple of my own apps/try to find a job. If that doesn't look like it's going well, I guess I could revisit the Galvanize/HackReactor option towards the end of the year.

On the running front, I'm having a hard time getting excited for Nolan's after completing Hardrock last weekend. Super psyched on that, but I kind of just feel like running some right now rather than slogging up more peaks. Maybe it would be good to wait for Jason to do it in 2018 anyway, but hard to let it linger for another year.
