# Hardrock Bio

John Knotts is a runner from Evergreen, Colorado. He loves to explore and has been drawn to the mountains for as long as he can remember. John's wife convinced him to run his first ultra in 2012 and he has been hooked ever since. As soon as he discovered Hardrock he knew he had to run it someday. And so began his plan to complete his first 100 – of course a Hardrock qualifier. 

In 2016, John finished 10 peaks on his first attempt at the Nolan's 14 line and his finish at the 2016 Bighorn 100 was his best ultra finish yet.

John is thrilled to get his first start at Hardrock this year and kissing the rock will definitely be the highlight of his running career.

Off the trail, John is learning to be a web developer and he is a proud husband and father of three.
