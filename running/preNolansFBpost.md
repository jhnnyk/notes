# pre-Nolan's FB post

[//]: # (Nolans14 FB group post)
Hello all,

I'm planning to start tomorrow about 7am. You can track me here: http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0V0lSL70dhjDrlGTHPPgGGk7Oh80xiRmG

Before I even start I need to thank my family and crew that will be out there supporting me. I couldn't even attempt this without you guys - Mandy Knotts, Joshua Wyse, Laura Wyse, Doug Oatis, Jared Winick, Niko Kovacevic, Rick Hoberg, & Andrew Bainbridge - especially Mandy who has to put up with my nonsense nearly 24/7! Thank you!! Let's get it done!

Hello all,
Some of you may remember my Nolan's 14 (http://mattmahoney.net/nolans14/) attempt from last year. It's a challenge that involves summiting 14 14,000+ ft peaks in the Sawatch Range of Colorado. Last year I made 10 of them. We teach our kids to finish what they start -- for me, sometimes it just takes more than one try! So I'll be back at it this weekend, planning to start tomorrow at about 7am. You can track me here: http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0V0lSL70dhjDrlGTHPPgGGk7Oh80xiRmG
